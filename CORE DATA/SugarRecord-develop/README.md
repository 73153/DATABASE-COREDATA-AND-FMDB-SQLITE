## What is SugarRecord?
SugarRecord is a management library to make it easier work with **CoreData and REALM**. Thanks to SugarRecord you'll be able to start working with **CoreData/REALM** with just a few lines of code:

1. Choose your preferred stack among the available ones (*You can even propose your own!*)
2. Enjoy with your database operations

The library is completely written in Swift and fully tested to ensure it behaves as expected.

**There's a Google Group where you can leave your topics, question, doubts, suggestions and stuff besides issues https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sugarrecord .**

**Powered by [@pepibumur](http://www.twitter.com/pepibumur) with the help of [@isaacroldan](www.twitter.com/saky), [@rdougan](www.twitter.com/rdougan) and some developers**

The scheme above shows the structure of SugarRecord. It's formed by:
- **Database Models Extensions**: To add the sugar syntax that links these models with SugarRecord and the database.
- **Finder**: SugarRecord custom element to abstract the querying components from the type of storage (Realm or CoreData)
- **Core**: Main component of the library that translates Save/Delete/Find calls into internal operations using the stacks set.
- **SugarRecord contexts**: Altough Realm doesn't have contexts as we have in CoreData, we have created abstracted contexts that surround the user operations with models independently if you are using CoreData or Realm. Yeah!
- **Stack**: The storage stack is another key piece in SugarRecord because it knows how and when persist/fetch/delete your objects into the database. You can tell SugarRecord which stack it should use.

## Features

- For beginners and advanced users
- **Fully customizable**. Implement your own stack and set it as your SugarRecord stack to work with.
- **Friendly syntax**. Forget about NSPredicates and NSSortDescriptors
- You can change between different stacks without affecting to the rest of your app.
- In case of a transition from CoreData to Realm or viceversa you've only to ensure the objecs have the same property names, and nothing more.
- Background operations are automatically managed by Sugar Record
- Support for Realm and CoreData using the same syntax
- Multiple stacks (for Realm, CoreData, CoreData+iCloud)
- Sugar syntax, forget about complicated lines of code to fetch your last 20 users!
- Written 100% in Swift and compatible with Swift projects (in case of Objective-C a wrapper is needed)
- Compatible with OSX and iOS
- Fully documented with a playground tutorial and an updated Wiki page
- Fully tested (all components are tested using XCTest)
- Actively supported, issues covered in less than a week.
- More powerful features to discover!

SugarRecord is almost completely the work of one man: me; Pedro Pinñera. I thoroughly enjoyed making SugarRecord, but nevertheless if you have found it useful then your bitcoin will give me a warm fuzzy feeling from my head right down to my toes
